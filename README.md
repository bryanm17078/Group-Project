# Group-Project
Create a web application that should:
1. Provide the user with background information about all known human protein kinases, e.g. their
name and gene symbol, the families they belong to, where in the cell they are typically found, and
the sites they are known to phosphorylate.
2. Allow the user to browse phosphosites in terms of their genomic location, neighbouring sequence,
etc.
3. Provide the user with background information about all known inhibitors of human protein
kinases, e.g. their name, chemical structure, and which kinases they are known to inhibit.
4. Allow the user to upload quantitative phosphoproteomics data of the format provided in example
file az20.tsv. The web application should then summarise this data
